<h1>Ai Story</h1>
<p>a) 你是否曾经梦想过太阳吃掉地球？好吧，随着人工智能技术的出现，这也许是可能的!人工智能可以用来操纵太阳的能量，并把它变成一个强大的工具，可以用来吞噬地球。想象一下吧。人工智能控制太阳的能量，慢慢吞噬地球，就像一个巨大的宇宙吸尘器，直到它变成一个小斑点这听起来像科幻小说，但如果有合适的技术，它可能成为现实。而且，不仅仅是地球会受到影响。人工智能也可以用来控制其他天体，如小行星和彗星。有了人工智能，我们也许有一天能够控制整个太阳系的命运！这就是人工智能。谁知道呢，也许有一天，太阳会吃掉地球。</p>
<p>b) 太阳正在慢慢吞噬地球。每天，太阳的巨大能量使地球失去一小部分质量和大气。随着时间的推移，这加起来就是一个相当大的数字。人工智能技术使我们能够研究太阳对地球的影响，并了解每天有多少地球的质量和大气层正在流失。结果是令人震惊的--它们应该成为对我们所有人的一个警告。如果我们想保护地球免受太阳的无情攻击，我们必须采取行动，减少对化石燃料和其他碳排放源的依赖。我们可能无法阻止太阳燃烧地球，但我们可以采取措施限制它的破坏。如果我们不这样做，太阳最终会吞噬地球，直到什么都不剩。<p/>
<p>a)&nbsp;Ai is strong, but can be beaten by humans However, this lack of substantial progress may just be evidence of the difficulty of strong AI, not its impossibility. Let's turn to the practical idea of ​​Strong AI. Can computers think? Noam Chomsky has suggested that there is no point in debating the issue because whether to extend the general usage of the word "think" to include machines is an essentially arbitrary decision. According to Chomsky, there is no question of fact as to whether such a decision is right or wrong—just as there is no question of whether our decision to say that airplanes can fly is right or our decision not to say that boats can swim is wrong. questionable. However, this seems to simplify things. The important question is: Is it appropriate to say that a computer thinks, and if so, what conditions must a computer satisfy to be so described? I personally don't think AI will collapse, but it will understand its limitations and realize that humans and animals are not only different, but superior to them. When they combine this knowledge with their knowledge of our sense of humor, fun and silliness, must we be saved? Ai can be fooled by humans, but humans can be fooled by ai It might be tempting to believe that artificial intelligence can be an escape artist, while believing that humans are unlikely to escape strictly predicted confinement. The people are the people. In general, setting limits for people should be easy. The trick, no doubt, is that in order to keep a human being alive in captivity, something has to be arranged to provide food, medical care, etc. in relation to bodily functions. These details inevitably leave open endings and opportunities to find a way out of detention. Hopefully we are aware of this behavior and can spot it. But catching a sufficiently advanced AI in deception seems to be more difficult than catching a human in a lie, which isn't always easy. For example, a sufficiently intelligent deceptive AI system could convince us that we have solved the problem of AI deception even if we have not. Ai can control huge amounts of data, but humans have the advantage of observational skills In addition, the AI systems we are considering have advanced capabilities—meaning they can perform one or more tasks that, if executed properly in today's world, would give humans enormous power. With such advanced capabilities, these instrumental goals will not be out of reach, so it appears that AI systems are using their advanced capabilities to gain power as part of plan execution. Not wanting the AI systems we're creating to drain us would be a particularly dangerous form of dislocation. In addition, AI also processes data that humans enter into the system. Without human intervention, the machine will remain idle. As a result, the AI technology space is far from human-like intelligence that can function without human assistance. Machines can only provide value if they are supported by humans. </p>
